/**
 * Ant Task to process parameter names. This ant task facilitates the
 * specification of the java source and class files to process as attributes,
 * nested file sets or a combination of both. The attributes applicable to
 * this ant task include a source directory, class directory, include pattern
 * and exclude pattern. i.e.:
 * <paranamer srcdir="src" classdir="classes" includes="*.java" excludes="excluded.java"/>
 * Each of these attributes contains a default:
 *  - srcdir: the base directory of the project
 *  - classdir: srcdir
 *  - includes: "**//*.java" (all java files below the current directory)
 *              this is to be consistent with the default fileset includes.
 *  - excludes: "" (none are excluded)
 * Thus,
 * <paranamer srcdir="." classdir="." includes="*.java"/>
 * <paranamer srcdir="." includes="*.java"/>
 * <paranamer srcdir="."/>
 * <paranamer/>
 * are equivalent.
 *
 * Files can be included in nested file sets via:
 * <paranamer>
 *  <fileset dir="." includes="*.java"/>
 * </paranamer>
 * In this case, for each file set the defaults are:
 *  - srcdir: dir
 *  - classdir: srcdir
 *  - includes: the default for ant standard file sets
 *  - excludes: the default for ant standard file sets
 * No additional fileset generated from the attribute defaults will be
 * constructed when embedded filesets are used. i.e.
 * <paranamer>
 *  <fileset dir="directory" includes="*.java"/>
 * </paranamer>
 * will not apply paranamer to the java files in ".".
 *
 * When mixing file sets and attributes, the classdir attribute is treated
 * differently. The classdir attribute will be applied to any files included
 * via srcdir or an embedded file set element. For example:
 * <paranamer classdir="classes"/>
 *  <fileset dir="." includes="*.java"/>
 *  <fileset dir="directory" includes="*.java"/>
 * </paranamer>
 * will require the classes to modify for the first fileset to reside in
 * the classes directory and those of the second fileset to reside in
 * classes/directory. Note that the default srcdir is not applied when embedded
 * filesets are used instead.
