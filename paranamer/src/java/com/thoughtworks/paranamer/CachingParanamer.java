/**
 * Implementation of Paranamer which delegate to another Paranamer implementation,
 * adding caching functionality to speed up usage. It also uses a WeakHashmap as
 * an implementation detail (wrapped in Collections.synchronizedMap(..)), to allow
 * large usages to garbage collect things as big as whole classloaders (after
 * working through all the refs that originated from that classloader). Tomcat and
 * other 'containers' do this during hot application deployment, undeployment and
 * most importantly for Paranamer redeployment.  Basically, this will allow a
 * perm-gen usage keeps growing scenario.
